[00:01.91]Fight Song - Rachel Platten
[00:03.15]Written byï¼šDave Bassett/Rachel Platten
[00:04.68]Like a small boat on the ocean
[00:08.38]
[00:10.12]Sending big waves into motion
[00:13.89]
[00:15.20]Like how a single word
[00:16.79]
[00:17.79]Can make a heart open
[00:19.41]
[00:20.98]I might only have one match
[00:22.69]
[00:23.63]But I can make an explosion
[00:25.43]
[00:26.61]And all those things I didn't say
[00:29.31]Wrecking balls inside my brain
[00:31.48]
[00:32.12]I will scream them loud tonight
[00:34.30]
[00:34.80]Can you hear my voice
[00:36.47]This time this is my fight song
[00:39.28]
[00:40.05]Take back my life song
[00:41.99]
[00:42.80]Prove I'm alright song
[00:47.00]
[00:48.27]My power's turned on
[00:50.51]Starting right now I'll be strong
[00:52.99]
[00:53.74]I'll play my fight song
[00:55.87]
[00:57.08]And I don't really care
[00:58.59]If nobody else believes
[01:02.06]
[01:02.61]Cause I've still got
[01:04.05]A lot of fight left in me
